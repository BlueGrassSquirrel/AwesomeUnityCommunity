# Welcome

Here you will find a list of resources organized in categories about all your needs during your development with the Unity3D editor.

## Considerations

1. Free assets and resources are prioritized over paid when possible.

2. There is always a posibility that this repository becomes outdated, mostly because new packages from the asset store and repositories appear in the future. This is because of the nature of technlogy and this can be avoided, so in order to keep this project as updated as possible with what other users know, please create a new issue to include or remove what you think is necessary.

3. Another point is the categorization of the resources provided here. Since some of them can be included in different categories at the same time a cross reference will be created in the form of a hastag to notify you (the visitor) that maybe you need to look in a different place of this repository or in other external site to find more info.

4. Finally, you need to know that this is not the only repository on Github that gathers Unity related repositories. This is just another try to get the best of all the existing content out there for Unity developers. So please, be grateful with all the other developers that put effort collection their respective lists of resources by visiting their repositories (they will be listed below).

5. Suggestions and contributions are always welcome. Make sure to read the <a href="https://github.com/agarcialeon/awesome-unity/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"> contribution guidelines </a> for more information before submitting a pull request.

I hope all of you find this helpful. Let's go with the contents.
